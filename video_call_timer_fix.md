# ⏰ Fixed: 1-Minute Timer Now Starts Only When Both Users Join

## ❌ **Previous Issue**

The 1-minute video call timer was starting **immediately** when the first user initiated the call, not when both users were actually connected. This meant:

- ❌ Timer started when first user clicked "Start Video Call"
- ❌ Second user might join with only 30-40 seconds left
- ❌ Unfair experience - timer should count down real conversation time
- ❌ Poor user experience for the second person to join

---

## ✅ **How It Works Now**

### **🎯 Perfect Timer Logic:**

1. **First User Starts Call** → Session created in "waiting" status, no timer
2. **Second User Joins Call** → Session becomes "active", 1-minute timer starts
3. **Both Users Connected** → Fair 60 seconds of video call time for both
4. **Timer Expires** → Call ends automatically after exactly 1 minute of conversation

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes** (`backend/routers/video.py`):

#### **1. Added Connected Users Tracking:**
```python
# Track connected users per session for timer management
connected_users = {}  # session_id -> set of user_ids
```

#### **2. Modified `start_video_call` Logic:**
- ❌ **Before**: Session immediately became "active" with `start_video_session()`
- ✅ **After**: Session stays in "waiting" status when first user starts

```python
# Create new video session (keep in waiting status)
session = create_video_session(db, match)
# Don't schedule auto-end yet - only when both users actually join
```

#### **3. Added New `/join-call/{session_id}` Endpoint:**
```python
@router.post("/join-call/{session_id}")
async def join_video_call(session_id: str, ...)
    # Track this user as connected
    connected_users[session_id].add(current_user.id)
    
    # Check if both users are now connected
    if expected_users.issubset(connected_session_users):
        # Start the session and 1-minute timer
        session.status = "active"
        session.started_at = datetime.utcnow()
        background_tasks.add_task(auto_end_session, session_id, db)
```

#### **4. Enhanced Cleanup:**
- Clears connected users tracking when sessions end
- Prevents memory leaks in production

---

### **Frontend Changes**:

#### **1. Added Join Call API** (`frontend/src/utils/api.ts`):
```typescript
joinCall: (sessionId: string) => api.post(`/api/video/join-call/${sessionId}`)
```

#### **2. Updated VideoCall Component Logic:**
```typescript
// Join the call - this will start timer only when both users are connected
const joinResponse = await videoAPI.joinCall(sessionId);

if (joinResponse.data.timer_started) {
  setIsCallStarted(true);  // Start frontend timer
  toast.success('Video call started! Both users connected.');
} else {
  setIsCallStarted(false);  // Wait for other user
  toast('Waiting for the other user to join...', { icon: '⏳' });
}
```

#### **3. Enhanced UI Status Display:**
- **Timer**: Only shows when both users connected
- **Waiting Status**: Shows "⏳ Waiting..." when waiting for other user
- **Clear Messages**: "Waiting for other user to join call..."
- **Timer Explanation**: "Timer will start when both users are connected"

## 🎉 **User Experience Now**

### **👤 First User (Caller):**
1. Clicks "Start Video Call" → Creates session
2. Joins video page → Sees "⏳ Waiting for other user to join call..."  
3. No timer countdown yet → Fair waiting experience
4. Other user joins → "🎉 Video call started! Both users connected."
5. Timer starts counting down from 1:00 → Fair conversation time

### **👤 Second User (Receiver):**
1. Gets notification → "📞 [User] wants to video call!"
2. Clicks "Join Call" → Enters video page
3. Automatically marks as joined → Triggers timer start for both users
4. Sees "🎉 Other user joined! Video call started." 
5. Timer starts from 1:00 → Full minute of conversation time

---

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **✅ Scenario 1: Both Users Join Quickly**
1. User A starts call → Session "waiting"
2. User B joins within 10 seconds → Session becomes "active" 
3. Both see 1:00 timer → Fair conversation time

### **✅ Scenario 2: Second User Takes Time**
1. User A starts call → Waits patiently with "⏳ Waiting..." status
2. User B joins after 30 seconds → Timer starts fresh at 1:00
3. Both get full minute of conversation → No time penalty

### **✅ Scenario 3: User Doesn't Join**
1. User A starts call → Waits for other user
2. User B never joins → No timer wasted
3. User A can leave without timer penalty → Clean experience
